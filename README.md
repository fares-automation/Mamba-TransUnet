This is my dissertation project, targetting segmentation of the left ventricle, leveraging deep learning and computer vision. A novel Convolutional Neural Network architecture.
The idea of the project came from my supervisor, Mr. Mazouni Fares. With his help, we were able to create a new cnn architecture that gave impressive results especially in the optimization aspects, compared to state-of-art algorithms.
