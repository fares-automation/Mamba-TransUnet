# Mamba-TransUnet
This is my dissertation project, targetting segmentation of the left ventricle, leveraging deep learning and computer vision. A novel Convolutional Neural Network architecture.
The idea of the project came from my supervisor, Mr. Mazouni Fares. With his help, we were able to create a new cnn architecture that gave impressive results especially in the optimization aspects, compared to state-of-art algorithms.
This work was done by replicating a total of 6 reasearch papers, that covers the following cnn architectures:
- U-net
- Gudu
- DeeplabV3
- NN-U-net
- TransUnet
All trained on the CAMUS dataset.
